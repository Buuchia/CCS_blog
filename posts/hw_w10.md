## Frustrating Aspect of the Process:

Deleting unwanted pane in flock.cc was confusing because sometimes it deleted the pane with the code that we actually wanted to keep, thankfully we saved a copy of the code so the damage was not severe, but still slowing down the workflow.

While doing live perfomance, it is difficult to keep track of the changed code, so sometimes when I wanted to revisit the older code to get the intended visual, I either forgot the value number or could not keep up the visual with the audio. If flock.cc has a preview window for the upcoming visual, it would be effective for performers to prepare exactly what visual they want to show in the main screen.

## Rewarding Aspect of the Process:

I was amazed at how convenient Hydra is in making creative coding accessible for beginners. It was fun to combine pieces of codes from a variety of creators to discover new visual effect patterns. Since I mainly took part in the visual part, while Mai Han worked on the audio, it was great to see how our results joined together on the same platform of flock.cc.

Although I complained about the struggle to keep track of the changed codes during live performance, I also found that accidents are also opportunities, as some visuals are discovered by chance and they looked cool. Therefore, that element of surprise is also a perk of live coding.

## What the live coding community trying to do and why

I think the live coding community is trying to encourage more people to get into the field by making it open-source, easy to use and explore, and of course fun. People may not know much about the technical aspect of live coding yet but they can play around with the given code from other creators, learn from those sources to produce something else interesting or even entirely different. In making live coding accessible to everyone, the community motivates people to be creative and digitally literate.
