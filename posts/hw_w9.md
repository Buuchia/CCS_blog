1. The project I heard TALKING IS DANGEROUS by Lauren Lee McCarthy is an example of mycelial creativity in these regards:

- It is omnidirection, which means that it involves a community of practice despite the geographic disadvantage due to the COVID-19. In this case, the work is a collaboration between the artist and her friends whose concerns address the fear of paranoia, lost of spoken communication, and discrimination during the pandemic. Even though they are not present in the same environment, they engage with each other through the use of a website turning text to speech on phones.

- It is accumulative, because each participant in the project, as different myceliums, inputs their own response about the problem based on their specific experiences into the website. Gradually, they inform a broader picture of what the fear of COVID-19 has caused to the trust between human relationships.

- It is transformational, because the website transforms the way the participant exchange conversation mechanically, from human's verbal communication to a machine's monotonous voice on the phone. Besides that, the work intrigues thoughts about what made us ***humans*** if we are not able to use our voice, and makes me rethink about my relationship with digital devices.

- It has the potential of producing fruiting bodies. Though being somewhat dystopian, the project explores an alternative way of expressing ideas and emotion, which gives people a virtual platform to connect, voice up their opnions about the matter, and blur the geographic gap between them. This can be effective and utopian when people cope with it.

I heard TALKING IS DANGEROUS by Lauren Lee McCarthy also belongs to the interesting category, because it is reflective, information-oriented, and critiques realism. The project discusses the central problems in the everyday's life during the pandemic, how to hang out and be together with people and the feeling of paranoia. Because of its administrative and 'cool' feeling, it has a 'mereness' quality, which toggle between interesting and boring depending on the viewer. It also involves circulation of information, an important characteristic of interesting, in the way that the website receives string of words and transforms the texts to speech to serve the comunnication purpose.
 

2. Brainstorming AT3

`First idea`:

I may engage with my lazy pet cat to form a community of practice. 

**Domain**: How to make our living room a fun interactive playground for my cat and me.

**Shared values**: we values comfort, solitary, quality time, family bonds.

**Existing repetoire**: we both enjoy staying indoors, doing activities that doesn't require a lot of running, being in a comfortable and relaxing environment with no strong light and  minimal sound, getting rewards and compliments for our efforts, and bonding with our family members.

**Brokering creative coding repetoire**: Since my cat shows no interest in any toys except for catching light reflection on our home's ceramic walls, I may borrow creative codes to create a game that mimics those light spots and projects the screen on the wall so that my cat can play anytime, without waiting for a sunny day. 

I imagine that in active mode, the screen will be dark and wherever the webcam sees my hand shape, it will create a light spot in that location. when the camera doesn't get the hand gesture, the game will play a soothing piece of music and run some falling pet treats from top to down.

`Second idea`:

My Thai roommate and a public art in my univerity's hall inspired me to create a website about self-affirmation, hence the community of practice will include my friends and I.

**Domain**: How to make the website an interactive, safe, comforting and mindful space for my friends and myself when we feel down and need emotional support.

**Existing repetoire**: We are international students enjoying exploring cultures and taking care of our well-being. Sometimes due to the infamilliarity with the environment or unpleasant experiences in schools or at work, we have self-doubt which impacts our self-esteem and questions our self-worth, so we need something or someone to remind us we are enough by giving us genuine care and compliments.

**Brokering creative coding repertoire**: The website takes inspiration from self-affirmation cards and requires participation from users to generate a meaningful interaction, utilising p5 creative coding tutorials. There are two ways to engage with the website:

Interaction 1: When the mouse moves on the canvas, the user will see a trail of heart emojis.

Interaction 2: When the user clicks on the canvas, particles forming the heart shape will appear with a quote of affirmation in the middle.

Or the quotes will fall or bounce in the background separate from the mouse interaction.
