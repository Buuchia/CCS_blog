1. The project I heard TALKING IS DANGEROUS by Lauren Lee McCarthy is an example of mycelial creativity in these regards:

- It is omnidirection, which means that it involves a community of practice despite the geographic disadvantage due to the COVID-19. In this case, the work is a collaboration between the artist and her friends whose concerns address the fear of paranoia, lost of spoken communication, and discrimination during the pandemic. Even though they are not present in the same environment, they engage with each other through the use of a website turning text to speech on phones.

- It is accumulative, because each participant in the project, as different myceliums, inputs their own response about the problem based on their specific experiences into the website. Gradually, they inform a broader picture of what the fear of COVID-19 has caused to the trust between human relationships.

- It is transformational, because the website transforms the way the participant exchange conversation mechanically, from human's verbal communication to a machine's monotonous voice on the phone. Besides that, the work intrigues thoughts about what made us ***humans*** if we are not able to use our voice, and makes me rethink about my relationship with digital devices.

- It has the potential of producing fruiting bodies. Though being somewhat dystopian, the project explores an alternative way of expressing ideas and emotion, which gives people a virtual platform to connect, voice up their opnions about the matter, and blur the geographic gap between them. This can be effective and utopian when people cope with it.

I heard TALKING IS DANGEROUS by Lauren Lee McCarthy also belongs to the interesting category, because it is reflective, information-oriented, and critiques realism. The project discusses the central problems in the everyday's life during the pandemic, how to hang out and be together with people and the feeling of paranoia. Because of its administrative and 'cool' feeling, it has a 'mereness' quality, which toggle between interesting and boring depending on the viewer. It also involves circulation of information, an important characteristic of interesting, in the way that the website receives string of words and transforms the texts to speech to serve the comunnication purpose.

2 - Brainstorm ideas regarding what community of practice you might engage with for your AT3 project.  Please include:

its domain
its shared values
its existing repertoire
how you might broker some creative coding repertoire to this new context

2. Brainstorming AT3
I may engage with my pet cat to form a community of practice.

**Domain**: How to engage my cat in doing exercise and how to make our living room a fun interactive playground for my cat and me.

**Shared values**: we both enjoy staying indoors, doing activities that doesn't require a lot of running, being in a comfortable and relaxing environment with no strong light and  minimal sound, getting rewards and compliments.

**Existing repetoire**:
