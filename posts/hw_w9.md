1 - Consider I heard TALKING IS DANGEROUS by Lauren Lee McCarthy. In what way could you consider this project to:

be an example of mycelial creativity?
belong to the aesthetic category of interesting?
2 - Brainstorm ideas regarding what community of practice you might engage with for your AT3 project.  Please include:

its domain
its shared values
its existing repertoire
how you might broker some creative coding repertoire to this new context

1. The project ***I heard TALKING IS DANGEROUS*** by Lauren Lee McCarthy is an example of mycelial creativity in these regards:

- It is omnidirection, which means that it involves a community of practice despite the geographic disadvantage due to the COVID-19. In this case, the work is a collaboration between the artist and her friends whose concerns address the fear of paranoia, lost of verbal connection, and discrimination during the pandemic. Even though they are not present in the same environment, they engage with each other through the use of a website turning text to speech on phones.

- It is accumulative, because each participant in the project, as different myceliums, inputs their own response about the problem based on their specific experiences into the website. Gradually, they inform a broader picture of what the fear of COVID-19 has caused to the trust between human relationships.

- It is transformational, because the website transforms the way the participant exchange conversation mechanically, from human's verbal communication to a machine's monotonous voice on the phone. Besides that, the work intrigues thoughts about what made us ***humans*** if we are not able to use our voice, and makes me rethink about my relationship with digital devices.

- It has the potential of producing fruiting bodies. Though being somewhat dystopian, the project explores an alternative way of expressing ideas and emotion, which can be effective.
