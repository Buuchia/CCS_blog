Hello, world!

# Homework 1

This is my sketch for the grid using nested **for** loop.
<iframe id="grid" src="https://editor.p5js.org/Buuchia/full/uFLvgJVuw"></iframe>

<script type="module">
 const iframe = document.getElementById(`grid`)
 iframe.width = iframe.parentNode.scrollWidth
 iframe.height = iframe.parentNode.scrollWidth + 42
</script>

This week I choose the work call [Float and Bounce](https://www.floatbounce.com/).
Using **mouseIsPressed** function to create circle when the mouse is pressed.
<iframe id="float_bounce_01" src="https://editor.p5js.org/Buuchia/full/dQtuHGwJP"></iframe>

<script type="module">
 const iframe = document.getElementById(`float_bounce_01`)
 iframe.width = iframe.parentNode.scrollWidth
 iframe.height = iframe.parentNode.scrollWidth + 42
</script>

I made a second attempt with the bounce and float effect.
<div align="center">
<iframe id="float_bounce_02" src="https://editor.p5js.org/Buuchia/full/RuNj1xzEt"></iframe>
</div>

<script type="module">
 const iframe = document.getElementById(`float_bounce_02`)
 iframe.width = iframe.parentNode.scrollWidth
 iframe.height = iframe.parentNode.scrollWidth + 42
</script>


# Homework 2

This week I choose the work called [Fill This Up](https://fillthisup.com/).
This is my process.
<iframe id="fill_this_up_01" src="https://editor.p5js.org/Buuchia/full/xeKlYQsdl"></iframe>

<script type="module">
 const iframe = document.getElementById(`fill_this_up_01`)
 iframe.width = iframe.parentNode.scrollWidth
 iframe.height = iframe.parentNode.scrollWidth + 42
</script>

# Homework 3

## Cute

As far as I understand about Sianne Ngai's cute aesthetic, cuteness is beyond being 'warm and fuzzy', its power and darkness lurk behind the vulnerable disguise. Cuteness makes people want to protect it, its fragility triggers not only care and empathy for it, but also the urge to control it and to justify our fantasy, which is the 'sadist' and 'fetishes' that I think Ngai meant. 

At first I don't not understand about the association between cuteness and consumption, but it somewhat makes more sense when I take my cats as an example to explain this.

When I look at my cats, they look so silly as if they could not live without me taking care of them. They are cute because they trigger my maternal instinct. I always want to pamper them and give them all the best, which leads me to buy all sorts of toys and food that they sometimes don't even bother to touch. Yet I still keep buying those things despite their liking or not, to a point I start asking myself if all these consumption were truly for them, or my cats' cuteness was just an excuse for me to satisfy my own fantasy of being a cat mom. Cuteness in this sense grasps the desire or fetish of the protector to demand more consumption, while the consumer is willing to consume for one wants no exchange value but cuteness in return, hence the power of its powerlessness.

Since I nurture my cats from when they were babies (and still are babies!) and cuddle them all the time, it is difficult to not think of them as my possessions. They kind of turned into my obsession, so when they act cute and friendly towards other people, sometimes I feel jealous and just want them to be cute to only me, or even feel the urge to hide them away so they can only be mine. I realize cuteness' intimacy does have the power to bring out the 'sadist', aggressive, and controlling tendency in a human nature.

Although the cute aesthetic influences consumption and has kitsch quality, I find it interesting that through an art medium, it may be avant-garde and challenge easy consumption. Cute in this context plays a critical part in assessing artistic expression.

The cute aesthetic can be thought as a way for us to think about the meaningful relationship between the subject and consumption, and offer a deeper understanding about what we humans are fascinated with and scared of.

## Effective Complexity

As defined during lecture, Effective Complexity is the balance between non-randomness (cohenrence) and non-redundancy (spiciness).

This relationship suggests a structure where elements can be organized into a structure which they aren't completely monotonous and completly chaotic. Monotomy is boring and repetitive, while chaos is too difficult to comprehend.

Therefore, effective complexity offers a structure where things can have similarities but also variations between each other, so non-randomness and a little bit of randomness make things juicier.
