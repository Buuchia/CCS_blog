Hello, world!

# Homework 1

This is my sketch for the grid using nested **for** loop.
<iframe id="grid" src="https://editor.p5js.org/Buuchia/full/uFLvgJVuw"></iframe>

<script type="module">
 const iframe = document.getElementById(`grid`)
 iframe.width = iframe.parentNode.scrollWidth
 iframe.height = iframe.parentNode.scrollWidth + 42
</script>

This week I choose the work call [Float and Bounce](https://www.floatbounce.com/).
Using **mouseIsPressed** function to create circle when the mouse is pressed.
<iframe id="float_bounce_01" src="https://editor.p5js.org/Buuchia/full/dQtuHGwJP"></iframe>

<script type="module">
 const iframe = document.getElementById(`float_bounce_01`)
 iframe.width = iframe.parentNode.scrollWidth
 iframe.height = iframe.parentNode.scrollWidth + 42
</script>

I made a second attempt with the bounce and float effect.
<div align="center">
<iframe id="float_bounce_02" src="https://editor.p5js.org/Buuchia/full/RuNj1xzEt"></iframe>
</div>

<script type="module">
 const iframe = document.getElementById(`float_bounce_02`)
 iframe.width = iframe.parentNode.scrollWidth
 iframe.height = iframe.parentNode.scrollWidth + 42
</script>


# Homework 2

This week I choose the work called [Fill This Up](https://fillthisup.com/).
This is my process.
<iframe id="fill_this_up_01" src="https://editor.p5js.org/Buuchia/full/xeKlYQsdl"></iframe>

<script type="module">
 const iframe = document.getElementById(`fill_this_up_01`)
 iframe.width = iframe.parentNode.scrollWidth
 iframe.height = iframe.parentNode.scrollWidth + 42
</script>

# Homework 3

## AT1 Concepts

### Cute

As far as I understand about Sianne Ngai's cute aesthetic, cuteness is beyond being 'warm and fuzzy', its power and darkness lurk behind the vulnerable disguise. Cuteness makes people want to protect it, its fragility triggers not only care and empathy for it, but also the urge to control it and to justify our fantasy, which is the 'sadist' and 'fetishes' that I think Ngai meant. 

At first I don't not understand about the association between cuteness and consumption, but it somewhat makes more sense when I take my cats as an example to explain this.

![My moo cat](/hw_w3/moo_cat.jpg)

When I look at my cats, they look so silly as if they could not live without me taking care of them. They are cute because they trigger my maternal instinct. I always want to pamper them and give them all the best, which leads me to buy all sorts of clothes,toys and food that they sometimes don't even bother to touch. Yet I still keep buying those things despite their liking or not, to a point I start asking myself if all these consumption were truly for them, or my cats' cuteness was just an excuse for me to satisfy my own fantasy of them wearing, playing, and eating those things and of myself being a devoted cat mom. Cuteness in this sense grasps the desire or fetish of the protector to demand more consumption, while the consumer is willing to consume for one wants no exchange value but cuteness in return, hence the power of its powerlessness.

Since I nurture my cats from when they were babies (and still are babies!) and cuddle them all the time, it is difficult to not think of them as my possessions. They kind of turned into my obsession, so when they act cute and friendly towards other people, sometimes I feel jealous and just want them to be cute to only me, or even feel the urge to hide them away so they can only be mine. I realize cuteness' intimacy does have the power to bring out the 'sadist', aggressive, and controlling tendency in a human nature.

![My british shorthair cat](/hw_w3/brit_short.jpg)

Although the cute aesthetic influences consumption and has kitsch quality, I find it interesting that through an art medium, it may be avant-garde and challenge easy consumption. Cute in this context plays a critical part in assessing artistic expression.

The cute aesthetic can be thought as a way for us to think about the meaningful relationship between the subject and consumption, and offer a deeper understanding about what we humans are fascinated with and scared of.

### Effective Complexity

As defined during lecture, Effective Complexity is the balance between non-randomness (cohenrence) and non-redundancy (spiciness).

This relationship suggests a structure where elements can be organized into a way that they aren't completely monotonous or completly chaotic. Monotomy is boring and repetitive, while chaos is too difficult to comprehend.

Therefore, effective complexity offers a structure where things can have similarities but also variations between each other. Within a cute aesthetic framework, non-randomness and a little bit of randomness make things cute and juicier.

For example, there is effective complexity in [Matt DesLauriers' Meridian](https://meridian.mattdesl.com/) project. The creative coder uses JavaScript program to make unique stratified landform paintings with random algorithms. The forms looks similar but they also varied and have different colors from each other, making them quite cute to me.

## AT1 Journey

I chose to respond to Rafael Rozendaal's [*return reverse*](https://www.returnreverse.com/) website.

The circles in the work slowly expand from the center of the website, as if they invite viewers to come closer, having the quality of intimacy that belongs to the cute aesthetic category. Although the work makes me feel that I am in a meditative trance at first, the longer I look at it, the more drained I feel. It demands my attention, triggering me to anticipate the next circle or next color coming out from its origin, so it's similar to what Ngai mentioned about the influence of cute on consumption. Additionally this work gradually becomes more difficult to consume, almost resisting to let viewer absorb at their own pace, so it also has that kind of avant-garde tactic associated with Ngai's cute aesthetic.

The artist employed effective complexity by generating iterations of simple circles with rotating hues of the colour wheel. These shapes have the same mechanic: born, expand, a new born drawn on top, and loop forever, but because each shape's color is varied and blended naturally together, the work achieves the balance between cohenrence (refering to shapes and their behaviour) and randomness (refering to the color).

### Atributes of the original work I would like to retain

- Shape drawn in the centre of the canvas.
- Meditative/Hypnotizing feel.
- Slow-motion approach of the shapes, or when they transform.
- Random color of the petals or 

### Aspects I would like to improve/change

- Change the circles to flower shape.
- Randomize color of the background in time with the flower transformation, instead of randomizing color of petals.


### The way my work in dialogue with Rafael Rozendaal's return reverse is in:

The title *return reverse* and the mechanical aspect the geometric shapes of the website inspire me to think about a loop of being born, disappearing, and being born again, which leads me to deep thoughts about life and how the universe works, where everything begins, ends, and a new beginning ensues. 

When one thinks of universe, it could be a starry sky or planets, but I came across a project called [Cosmic Bloom](https://outland.art/cosmic-bloom/) by Leo Villareal that also achieved effective complexity. The artist draws from the inspirations of 'organic and biological structures, stellar phenomena, and atomic patterns', layering and multiplying geometric forms, and using algorithms to create random moving patterns, which resembles flowers, hence its name. 

Using the imagery of a flower to represent the universe is not entirely new, but the fact that something so vast like the universe can be reduced to a small thing like flower is really cute and organic. I really like the idea that digital works
 can be natural.

So I will communicate with Rafael Rozendaa's *return universe* through the motion of a flower's disk floret pattern, perhaps like that of a [sunflower](https://www.freepik.com/free-photo/closeup-shot-beautiful-sunflower-with-bee-it_14256372.htm#fromView=search&page=1&position=1&uuid=4e1b5ad3-c2cf-4601-81b6-7d9d362faa03).

### How JavaScript Techniques and Design Concepts I use contribute to the aesthetic of my response?
**Design Concept** 
1. I will create a hypnotic flower. 
2. The hypnotizing effect is needed to evoke the feeling of meditation then gradually turns into somewhat trippy if the viewer maintains the gaze with it after a long time. 

**Javascript Technique**
- Flower stays in the center of the canvas.
- Each flower shape has some transparency, so not solid fill.
- Hypnotizing effect may be achieved with slow motion, when the flower layers transform, when they are bigger and approaching.
- Rotating hue.
- Blend mode.
- for loop, since I need to make iterations of the flower layers.
- Make a flower object in a class.
- Some conditional statements.
- Random with map function (for background).
- Array of petals (?).
- Vertex because I will need to draw the petals.
