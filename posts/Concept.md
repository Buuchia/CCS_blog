### [Trigonometry](https://www.pattvira.com/creative-coding-math/v/trigonometry-and-polar-coordinates)
Study of the relationship between sides and angles of a triangle.
Focus on a right triangle: one 90 degree angle on the right and three sides. The angle opposite to the 90 degree angle is called theta.
