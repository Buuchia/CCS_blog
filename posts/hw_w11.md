**Question**: In what ways might the practice of creative coding attend to problems regarding digital infrastructure?

To deal with problems regarding digital infrastructure such as walled garden and vectoralist superstructure, education of creative coding is likely to be the solution. The practice of creative coding needs to be visible and emphasised to more communities other than the wealthier ones, to learners from an early age, perhaps since kindergarten so that they could cultivate a sense of belonging to the community. Seeing other people practice JavaScript coding and believe they can do so, too. Schools could make JavaScript a fundamental language in mandatory course, helping it less intimidating to students by incorporating coding with entertainment context, such as promoting interactive coding games and coding for artistic expressions. By expanding the creative horizon away from the spectacle built by the vectoralist superstructure, the society can move forward with a more digital literate population. Therefore, creative coding practices should not be gatekept for profit but be invested and accessible to communities globally and equally so that people could achieve a better living condition.
