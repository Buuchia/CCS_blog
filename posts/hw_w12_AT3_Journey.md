Script for my A3

## My Plan

Inspired by Lauren Lee McCarthy's I heard TALKING IS DANGEROUS, I want to create a website that users can participate and respond to for my A3 Creative Coding assignment. Since both Poon, my Thai roommate and I are international students living in the same Scape community of practice, we both understand the struggles of living abroad away from our family and hometowns, such as experiencing self-doubt and low self-esteem, so we need a platform where we can get emotional support to take care of our mindfulness and mental well-being. Therefore, having a safe, comforting, and interactive digital space, which is the website that reminds my roommate to practice self-affirmation is the domain of our community of practice. 

To make this work, I am going to broker creative coding knowledge from the p5js community, which I have been a part of since the start of this semester, to our community of practice. In doing so, Poon may find creative coding therapeutic, while I can also learn from her feedback to enrich my coding skill as she had some experience in play-testing websites from her previous jobs.

In short, my p5 sketch will display heart shapes with random self-affirmation messages when Poon's mouse double-clicks on the canvas. If she drags the mouse across the canvas, the cursor will show a trail of falling hearts. She can also choose the background images from the drop-down menu, and play or pause the soothing meditative music.
